   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Method 2: Download ZIP File

   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to your desired location

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Server Setup

The backend server handles POE bot integration and must be running for the legal chat functionality to work.

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   **Note**: This will automatically install Playwright browsers during the postinstall step, which may take a few minutes.

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add the following environment variables to `.env`:
   ```env
   PORT=4000
   POE_COOKIE_STRING=your_poe_cookie_string_here
   POE_BOT_PATH=/Doccie
   ```
   
   **Important**: 
   - `POE_COOKIE_STRING` is required for the backend to authenticate with Poe. You can get this from your browser's cookies when logged into poe.com.
   - `PORT` is optional (defaults to 4000 if not specified)
   - `POE_BOT_PATH` is optional (defaults to `/Doccie` if not specified)

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   Or for development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The server will start on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

5. **Verify the backend is running**:
   - You should see console output indicating the server is listening on port 4000
   - If `POE_COOKIE_STRING` is not set, you'll see a warning message, but the server will still start

**Note**: Both the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 4000) servers need to be running simultaneously for the full application to work.
